			<p>
				I am a software developer in Atlanta, GA USA. I do things like:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python development, with expertise in Django, Pylons, SQLAlchemy</li>
				<li>.NET development, with expertise in...finding ways to do it in Python instead</li>
				<li>Software Architecture for moderately complicated environments</li>
				<li>Play with Clojure, OCaml, and other cool stuff. More on this later.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			You can reach me by most civilized means such as email (mattculbreth at gmail) and <a href="http://twitter.com/mattc58">Twitter</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>I'm also on Facebook, but I can't figure out how to link to my specific profile.  Just as well since I don't use it much. Same goes for <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattculbreth">LinkedIn</a>, but at least I could figure out my public page URL there.
